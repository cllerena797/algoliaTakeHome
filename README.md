This project is intended to showcase the NBA Team Scores and to let users find teams with ease. The search bar lets users search based on Team Names and Team Locations. Additonally, users can filter results based on range of score and city. My goal was to make the UI appealing yet simple to understand and use. From the familiar NBA logo included in the header, users know immediately what industry and organization they are searching for information under. The UI also includes teams' logos to help users distinguish teams and even let users learn more about them by seeing their unique branding. 

My feedback to Algolia would be to distinguish the InstantSearch.js library and the InstantSearch UI demo. There was some confusion on the difference between the two. Other than that, the documentation was easy to follow and insightful for someone like me who is new to search engines and creating indices.
