Question 1: Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

Hi George,

Of course, I'm happy to provide some context on the concepts you included and help in your onboarding and search engine knowledge! 

Here are some definitions and additional information:

Records - A record is a data point or data element in your data set. It is an object that then has attributes about it. For example for a data set of basketball teams, one team would be a record. That record then has a name, the basketball team's name, a score, the basketball team's score, and so on. 

Indexing - Indexing is preparing and optimizing your data to be searchable. This means uploading a dataset into Algolia, as an index, and then setting attributes for searching, filtering etc. The best way to optimize your data to be searched is to only include data and attributes that are meant to be displayed, searched, and filtered by your consumers/users.

Custom Ranking - Custom Ranking helps Algolia understand your business and products better, resulting in your users understanding both better as well. If you have any popular or highly-ranked products, these would be great to use for your Custom Ranking since they will help Algolia build an even better search for your users to easily find those favored products. 

Hope this helps but please let me know if you have any additional questions that come up!

Best,
Carolina Llerena

Question 2: Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt

Response 2:
Hi Matt,

I'm sorry to hear that you're encountering some inconvenience with the dashboard and your feedback is much appreciated. This new design, specifically the update to clearing and deleting indexes, is to ensure the protection of your indices and all your work. At Algolia, we want to make sure that customer's don't accidentally clear or delete their indices and lose all the settings they've been working on with just one click. 

We value your opinion and here at Algolia we are always looking for ways to create a better experience for our customers! I will take your feedback to our product teams for consideration as we work to expand and improve.

If you have any questions or additional feedback, feel free to email or call me at 650-636-5209.

Best,
Carolina

Question 3: Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards, Leo

Hi Leo,

Great question, from previous experience with customers, this process is not a heavy lift for our customer's teams and we are always hear to assist and lessen the lift from your end.

Happy to detail out the process for you with some quick bullet points:

1. Prepare your data and send it to Algolia
2. Configure your data setting and attributes for Algolia to understand your data better and build the most optimized search possible
3. Add your new search to your company's UI or build one using our step by step guides
4. Go live with your search and let your users reap the benefits!

Please feel free to reach out with any questions that may come up along the way! 

Best,
Carolina
